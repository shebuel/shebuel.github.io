### On a more personal note...

Hello there! My name is Shebuel (I *do* go by Sheb most of the time though) and my life is anything but complicated. I am interested in anything that poses a challenge and requires learning a lot of new things (One of the main reasons I chose infosec!). 

Though my primary interests lay in the blue side, I do have a decent knowledge of the red side and like cracking the occasional box here and there. 

I love interacting with other people especially in subjects I am passionate about. So if you want to collab on some project, discuss some new trends or just want a chat hit me up! Just send me an email at *jshebuel.infosec@gmail.com* or ping me in discord (TysonAsh#3843) or twitter!

### Projects I am currently working on...

- Deception in the field of Cybersecurity
- Playing around with Android memory forensics

Stay Tuned!
