<p>This is a project that I did for my Cloud Security course in the University of Maryland, College Park as part of my Master’s in Cybersecurity.</p>

<p>The main objective of this project was to analyze and implement all of the security and logging features a cloud platform (AWS in my case) has to offer. We were essentially given a server which was a Ubuntu VM running an Apache web server and were expected to deploy it in the cloud with minimum to no down time while making sure that once the server is in the cloud it is resistant to DoS attacks, has proper logging features and alerts setup to detect intruders.</p>

<p>The name of the server was “Troll World” so every reference to the server is by that name. You can find the documentation for the project <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1drelRMB746n8cgOpcj7xA9hU1Ud6hV8X/view?usp=sharing">here</a></p>
